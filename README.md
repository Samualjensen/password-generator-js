# Password Generator
 
## Description

The third weekly challenge is to use the starter code provided to us and write the javascript portion of it to make it generate a random password. To meet the goal of the challenge we need to write code that that creates prompts that ask the user to select if they would like to make a password, how many characters that password will be, and then a series of prompts that defines what characters that password will consist of. When the user finishes the series of prompts than it will output a random password based on their choices.
